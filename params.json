{"name":"Posh-ssh","tagline":"","body":"#Description\r\nPowershell module that leverages a custom version of the SSH.NET Library (http://sshnet.codeplex.com/) to provide basic SSH functionalyty in Powershell.\r\nThe main purpose of the module is to facilitate automating actions against one or multiple SSH enabled servers.\r\n\r\n#Install\r\nTo install the module including all source code you can just run in a PowerShell v3 the following command:\r\n<pre>\r\niex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\"https://gist.github.com/darkoperator/6152630/raw/c67de4f7cd780ba367cccbc2593f38d18ce6df89/instposhsshdev\")\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n#Support\r\n* Provides functionality for automating SSH, SFTP and SCP actions.\r\n* Supports diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1, diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 and diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange methods.\r\n* Supports 3des-cbc, aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc, aes256-cbc, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr, blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, arcfour and twofish encryptions.\r\n* Supports hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-ripemd160, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-256-96, hmac-md5-96 and hmac-sha1-96 hashing algorithms.\r\n* Supports publickey, password and keyboard-interactive authentication methods\r\n* Supports RSA and DSA private key\r\n* Supports DES-EDE3-CBC, DES-EDE3-CFB, DES-CBC, AES-128-CBC, AES-192-CBC and AES-256-CBC algorithms for private key encryption\r\n* Supports SOCKS4, SOCKS5 and HTTP Proxy\r\n* Remote, dynamic and local port forwarding\r\n\r\n#ChangeLog\r\n\r\n##Version 1.3\r\n* Option to auto accept SSH Fingerprint (Don't personally like it but gotten enough requests to make me do it)\r\n* Set index to default parameter set.\r\n* Added keep alive for connections.\r\n* Enabled Dynamic Port Forward function.\r\n* Help XML file now properly shows parameter sets.\r\n* Fixed several typos.\r\n\r\n##Version 1.2\r\n* Added support for zlib compression.\r\n* Disabbled Dynamic Port Forward function, there seems to be problems with the library.\r\n\r\n##Version 1.1\r\n* Added functions for managing SSH Trusted Host list.\r\n* SCP, SSH Session and SFTP Session cmdlets now verify the SSH Host Fingerprint.\r\n* Complete refactor of the cmdlets for SSH Session, SFTP Session and SCP.\r\n* Added Download and Upload Progress to SCP cmdlets.\r\n* Patched the Renci SSH .Net library to correct problems when uploading using SCP.\r\n\r\n# ToDo\r\n* Add progress for SFTP upload and Download\r\n\r\n# Know Issues\r\n* No Compression support at the moment.\r\n* Once a Download or Upload is started only way to cancel is by closing PowerShell.\r\n* Subterminals are not supported (su, vi, vim)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
